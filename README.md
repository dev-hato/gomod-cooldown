# gomod-cooldown

[日本語版](README.ja.md)

`gomod-cooldown` is a local wrapper for dependency updates. It starts a
temporary loopback-only GOPROXY, filters version discovery during the command,
then shuts the proxy down.

> This tool filters version discovery during dependency updates. It does not
> block downloading explicitly requested or already-pinned versions.

It is a workflow aid, not a security boundary or a download-blocking proxy.
It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the Go project or Google.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/dev-hato/gomod-cooldown/cmd/gomod-cooldown@latest
```

Or build the checked-out source with `go build ./cmd/gomod-cooldown`.

## Usage

```sh
gomod-cooldown --cooldown=14d -- go get -u all
```

The syntax is `gomod-cooldown [flags] -- command [args...]`; the command is
started directly with its original argv, never through a shell. The child gets
only the temporary local URL as `GOPROXY`; the caller's environment and `go env`
configuration are unchanged.

Flags:

- `--cooldown=14d` accepts Go durations plus `d` as exactly 24 hours (for
  example `168h`, `7d`, or `14d12h`). It must be positive.
- `--upstream=https://proxy.golang.org` selects the single fixed upstream.
- `--time-source=commit` (default) uses only `.info.Time` and has the same
  per-module discovery shape as normal Go commands. `combined` is an explicit,
  high-cost mode that also uses index timestamps.
- `--upstream-timeout=30s` bounds upstream HTTP requests.
- `--verbose` emits upstream-request and decision diagnostics.

## What is filtered

Only these version-discovery endpoints are filtered:

```
/<module>/@v/list
/<module>/@latest
```

All version-specific endpoints, including `.info`, `.mod`, and `.zip`, and all
other GOPROXY endpoints are passed through to the configured upstream. Therefore
an explicit request such as `go get example.com/mod@v1.2.3` and a version already
recorded in `go.mod` can be downloaded even during its cooldown.

If an upstream `@v/list` names a version whose `.info` endpoint returns 404 or
410, the wrapper treats only that unavailable version as unusable and omits it
from discovery. That negative result is cached for the rest of the CLI
invocation. Other `.info` failures, including 403, 429, 5xx, transport errors,
and malformed or inconsistent metadata, continue to fail discovery with 502.

Implicit discovery also avoids selecting a higher `+incompatible` version only
because the cooldown removed the highest usable compatible version named by the
raw list. If the removed compatible version has a real, module-aware `.mod`
file, higher `+incompatible` candidates are omitted. A synthetic legacy `.mod`
containing only `module <path>` is not treated as evidence of module awareness, so those
candidates remain visible. An exact or already-pinned `+incompatible` version
remains downloadable through the version-specific pass-through endpoints.

GOPROXY discovery requests do not tell the proxy the original version query or
the currently selected version. Consequently, this safeguard can also make a
version-prefix query such as `@v2` invisible to implicit discovery; request an
exact version when that distinction matters.

The wrapper intentionally does not append `https://proxy.golang.org,direct` (or
any fallback) to the child's `GOPROXY`: a discovery 404 must not bypass the
cooldown via a later proxy.

Validated `.info` metadata used for version decisions is also cached in memory
and reused only for the lifetime of one CLI invocation. All caches are discarded
at exit and are not carried into the next invocation. The mutable `@v/list` and
`@latest` responses themselves are fetched from the upstream for every request.

## Availability time

`.info.Time` is a commit time, not a publish time: a new tag can point at an old
commit. This is the default availability source because it only requires
per-module proxy requests and remains practical for interactive use.

The official `index.golang.org` feed supplies the time a module version was
first cached by `proxy.golang.org`. That first-cached time is an availability
time, not an exact tag publish time.

`--time-source=combined` is deliberately opt-in. The index has no per-module
lookup API, so startup reads the complete chronological global feed from the
cutoff through the present using `since` and `limit=2000`, paging until the final
short page. It can take a long time for a large cooldown window. A malformed
record, HTTP failure, timeout, or cursor that does not advance fails setup closed;
it never silently falls back to commit time. This mode requires the exact
official `https://proxy.golang.org` upstream.

For each discovery candidate:

```
availableAt = max(commitTime, firstCachedTime)
cutoff = now - cooldown
allow when availableAt <= cutoff
```

Versions absent from the fully read recent snapshot are treated as first-cached
before the cutoff. The index/proxy relationship can race, so this is not a
strict security boundary.

If an upstream `@latest` is too recent, the wrapper filters `@v/list` and
returns the highest eligible tagged release; if no release remains it chooses
the highest tagged pre-release. It does not invent pseudo-versions. A module
whose only usable older history is pseudo-versions may therefore return 404 for
`@latest`, while a pinned pseudo-version remains downloadable via its
version-specific endpoints.

## Notes and troubleshooting

- `GOPRIVATE` and `GONOPROXY` may cause the Go command to bypass this proxy.
  That is normal Go behavior; this tool does not control private-module access.
- The module cache may satisfy a command without a network request. Use a fresh
  cache when testing proxy behavior.
- A 502 means discovery metadata or the complete index snapshot could not be
  validated. The wrapper logs the cause to stderr rather than treating it as an
  empty list.
- Excluded versions are logged with module, version, commit time, available
  first-cached time, effective availability time, and cutoff.
- This is not a substitute for Dependabot security updates. It is intended to
  be used alongside them.

## Development

```sh
gofmt -w cmd internal
go mod tidy
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
golangci-lint run
golangci-lint fmt
```

Tests use `httptest.Server`, injected clients/clocks, and no external network.
End-to-end cases run the real Go command against a local fake GOPROXY. They also
exercise byte-for-byte, fixed-commit `go.mod` snapshots from Prometheus, Helm,
and Caddy; fixture provenance is recorded in
[`internal/cli/testdata/large-modules`](internal/cli/testdata/large-modules).
GitHub Actions runs tests, race detection, vet, and `golangci-lint`. For an
in-repository pull request, a separate workflow runs `gofmt`/`goimports` and
opens or updates a formatting pull request when safe changes are available.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [imjasonh/go-cooldown](https://github.com/imjasonh/go-cooldown).
It differs by filtering only version discovery endpoints, while allowing
explicitly requested and already-pinned versions to be downloaded.
